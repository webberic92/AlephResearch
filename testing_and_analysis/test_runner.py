# Script or program to run tests, start nodes, and initiate transactions.

# Notes:

#     Database Credentials: Ensure the environment variables for database connection details are set correctly.
#     Queries: Modify SQL queries according to your actual log schema.
#     CSV Files: The output CSV files can be imported into BI tools like Amazon QuickSight or Excel for further analysis and visualization.

# Whatâ€™s Missing/Needed from You:

#     Test Command: Provide the actual command used to start your test on the EC2 instances.
#     Log Schema: Confirm or provide the exact structure of your log table for accurate SQL queries.
#     BI Tool Configurations: Let me know if there are specific BI tools you plan to use, so I can tailor the analysis script accordingly.
