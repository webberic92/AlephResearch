# Main entry point for the CDK application, initializes all stacks.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Notes:

#     Import Paths: Ensure the import paths match your directory structure. You might need to adjust these paths if your modules or stack files are located differently.
#     Stack Initialization: Each stack is initialized with a unique identifier (e.g., "CiCdPipelineStack", "AlephDeploymentStack"). Modify these names as needed to fit your naming conventions.
#     Execution: Run this script to deploy your CDK application. Ensure you have the AWS CDK CLI installed and configured.

# Whatâ€™s Missing/Needed from You:

#     Stack Classes: Confirm that the stack classes (e.g., CiCdPipelineStack, AlephDeploymentStack) are correctly defined and imported in your respective modules.
#     Dependencies: Make sure all necessary CDK libraries and dependencies are included in your requirements.txt or package.json, depending on your setup.
