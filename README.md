# aleph-orig

The `aleph-orig` branch is a crucial part of the AlephResearch project, which focuses on improving the Aleph protocol's communication complexity. This branch implements the original Aleph protocol, specifically using Merkle trees in its Reliable Broadcast Communication (RBC) protocol.

## Purpose

The `aleph-orig` branch serves as the baseline for performance comparison and benchmarking. It provides a reference implementation of the original Aleph protocol, allowing us to evaluate the impact of various enhancements introduced in other branches, such as `aleph-rsa`.

## Key Features

- **Original Aleph Protocol**: Implements the Aleph protocol as initially designed, using Merkle trees for the RBC protocol.
- **Benchmarking**: Provides a reference point for assessing performance improvements in modified versions of the Aleph protocol.
- **Baseline for Comparison**: Serves as the standard against which enhancements and optimizations are measured.

## Overview

AlephResearch is dedicated to exploring the efficiency of the Aleph protocol by comparing different configurations. The `aleph-orig` branch plays a vital role in understanding the protocol's communication overhead and scalability, providing a foundation for evaluating enhancements made in subsequent branches.
